title: Installing Cloud Foundry on OpenStack
---

This topic describes how to install Cloud Foundry on OpenStack.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These instructions are for the v170 release of Cloud Foundry. For newer versions of Cloud Foundry, please <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-deploying-cf/issues/new">let us know</a> if this documentation continues to work or needs to be updated.</p>

## Goal ##

By the end of this topic, Cloud Foundry will be installed and running on OpenStack.
You will be able to target it using your own DNS, login, and upload a simple application.

For example, you will be able to do the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf target api.mycloud.com
$ cf login admin
Password> ******
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf_demoapp_ruby_rack.git
$ cd cf_demoapp_ruby_rack
$ cf push
$ open http://hello.mycloud.com
Hello World!
</pre>

## Requirements ##

It is assumed that you have [validated your OpenStack](validate_openstack.html) and [have a BOSH deployment running](deploying_microbosh.html).

It is also required that you have provisioned an IP address and setup your DNS to map `*` records to this IP address. For example, if you were using `mycloud.com` domain as the base domain for your Cloud Foundry, you need a `*` A record for this zone mapping to your provisioned IP address.

Confirm in your local terminal that you have the installed the BOSH CLI and have targeted your BOSH:

<pre class="terminate">
$ bosh status
Config
             /Users/example/.bosh_config

Director
  Name       mybosh
  URL        https://1.2.3.4:25555
  Version    1.5.0.pre.939 (release:930f73f5 bosh:930f73f5)
  User       admin
  UUID       18bbfe79-6ccf-4020-b1c7-6f19d67a8c9c
  CPI        openstack
  dns        enabled (domain_name: microbosh)
  compiled_package_cache disabled

Deployment
  not set
</pre>

You will use the `UUID` value found above when configuring your manifest.

You have two flavors setup **with ephemeral disks**:

* `m1.small` - for example, 1 CPU, 2G RAM, 20G ephemeral disk
* `m1.medium` - for example, 2 CPU, 4G RAM, 20G ephemeral disk

You have two security groups:

* `default`
* `cf` - opens all ports (until further understanding of what ports are required for each job of Cloud Foundry)

## Upload BOSH Release ##

To deploy Cloud Foundry, your BOSH needs to be given the BOSH release it will use. This includes all the packages and jobs. The Cloud Foundry BOSH release includes dozens of jobs and almost 100 packages. Enforcing consistency and guaranteed output of a deployment is one of the reasons we prefer BOSH for deploying a complex system like Cloud Foundry.

You can now create and upload the Cloud Foundry BOSH release ([cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release)).

[Follow these instructions.](../common/cf-release.html)

Confirm that you have a release "cf" uploaded:

<pre class="terminate">
$ bosh releases

+------+----------+-------------+
| Name | Versions | Commit Hash |
+------+----------+-------------+
| cf   | 170      | aabs1233ad  |
+------+----------+-------------+
</pre>

## Upload a base stemcell ##

A cloud provider needs a base image to provision VMs/servers. BOSH explicitly requires that the base image includes the [Agent](/bosh/terminology.html#agent). Therefore, we use specific base images which are known to have a BOSH agent installed. These base images are called BOSH **stemcells**.

To upload the latest BOSH stemcell to your BOSH:

<pre class="terminate">
$ wget http://bosh-jenkins-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-stemcell/openstack/bosh-stemcell-latest-openstack-kvm-ubuntu.tgz
$ bosh upload stemcell bosh-stemcell-latest-openstack-kvm-ubuntu.tgz
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: There has been a <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/62108468">report</a> on the vcap-dev mailing list that cf-release v147 and other releases through v150 are incompatible with some latest versions of openstack-kvm-ubuntu stemcell. The stemcell that works for the user reporting the issue is <a href="https://bosh-jenkins-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-stemcell/openstack/bosh-stemcell-1256-openstack-kvm-ubuntu.tgz">1256</a>.</p>

Confirm that you have at least one BOSH stemcell loaded into your BOSH:

<pre class="terminate">
$ bosh stemcells

+--------------------------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| Name                           | Version | CID                                     |
+--------------------------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| bosh-openstack-kvm-ubuntu      | 1055    | sc-f66fc9db-150d-4e2e-b78f-ad4ab7fc7ad1 |
+--------------------------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+

Stemcells total: 1
</pre>

## Other preparation

OpenStack uses security groups for restricting/allowing ports to a set of servers.

You need to create a security group `cf`:

* allow all ports to talk to all ports of servers using the same `cf` security group
* allow port 22 for administrator SSH access
* allow 80 for HTTP traffic (primarily for the router)

## Create a minimal deployment file ##

The next step towards deploying Cloud Foundry is to create a `deployment file`. This is a YAML file that describes exactly what will be included in the next deployment. This includes:

* the VMs to be created
* the persistent disks to be attached to different VMs
* the networks and IP addresses to be bound to each VM
* the one or more job templates from the BOSH release to be applied to each VM
* the custom properties to be applied into configuration files and scripts for each job template

A deployment file can describe 10,000 VMs using a complex set of Neutron subnets all the way down to one or more VMs without any complex inter-networking. You can specify one job per VM or colocate multiple jobs for small deployments.

There are many different parts of Cloud Foundry that can be deployed. In this section, only the bare basics will be deployed that allow user applications to be run that do not require any services. The minimal set of jobs to be included are:

* `dea`
* `cloud_controller_ng`
* `gorouter`
* `nats`
* `postgres`
* `hm9000`
* `syslog_aggregator`
* `debian_nfs_server` (see below for using Swift as the droplet blobstore)
* `uaa`

There are different ways that networking can be configured. If your OpenStack has Neutron running, then you can use advanced compositions of subnets to isolate and protect each job, thus providing greater security. In this section, no advanced networking will be used.

Only a single public IP is required. Replace `REPLACE-IP-ADDRESS` with your allocated IP address below.

### Initial manifest for OpenStack ###

Create a `~/bosh-workspace/deployments/cf` folder and create `~/bosh-workspace/deployments/cf/demo.yml` with the initial deployment file displayed below.

Change the following at the top of the file:

* replace `REPLACE-DIRECTOR_UUID` with the UUID from `bosh status`
* replace `REPLACE-IP-ADDRESS` with the IP address you allocated above
* replace `root_domain` value with a DNS, say `mycloud.com` that has `*.mycloud.com` mapped to your IP; defaults to using http://xip.io service for DNS
* replace the `common_password`; even better is to put in lots of different passwords and tokens throughout the deployment file

Further, note that you need to have configured the "cf-public" and "cf-private" security groups as outlined in [these instructions](../common/security_groups.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This deployment manifest is compatible with the v170 release of Cloud Foundry.</p>

## Deploying your own Cloud Foundry ##

In this section, your BOSH will be instructed to provision 9 VMs (specified in the manifest), binding the router to your IP address, and running the minimal, useful set of jobs mentioned above. In the subsequent section, you well deploy a sample application to your Cloud Foundry

First, target your BOSH CLI to your manifest file. Use either:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployment ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/cf/demo.yml
</pre>

Then, we upload the deployment file to your BOSH and instruct it to "deploy" your Cloud Foundry service.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deploy
</pre>

### What is happening now? ###

The first time you deploy a BOSH release it will compile every package that it needs for your deployment. You will see something like:

<pre class="terminal">
Compiling packages
buildpack_cache/2,...  |                        | 0/23 00:00:32  ETA: --:--:--
</pre>

And later...

<pre class="terminal">
  Compiling packages
    buildpack_cache/2 (00:02:39)
    insight_agent/2 (00:02:49)
    nginx/9 (00:00:49)
golang/2, gorouter/10,...  |ooo                     | 4/23 00:02:15  ETA: 00:04:04
</pre>

If you visit your OpenStack dashboard, you will see a number of VMs have been provisioned. Each of these VMs is being assigned a single package to compile. When it completes, it uploads the compiled binaries and libraries for that package into the BOSH blobstore. These compiled packages can be used over and over and never need compilation again.

Finally, the initial compilation of packages ends (after about 15 minutes in the example below):

<pre class="terminal">
  ...
  login/19 (00:00:37)
  uaa/30 (00:00:38)
  dea_next/22 (00:00:51)
Done                    23/23 00:09:16
</pre>

Next it boots the 9 VMs mentioned in the deployment file above:

<pre class="terminal">
Creating bound missing VMs
  common/1 (00:01:49)
  common/0 (00:02:53)
  common/2 (00:03:31)
  common/3 (00:01:53)
  common/5 (00:01:32)
  common/4 (00:02:10)
  common/6 (00:01:51)
  common/7 (00:01:07)
  large/0 (00:01:54)
Done                    9/9 00:07:34
</pre>

Finally it assigns each VM a job (which is a list of one or more job templates from the [cf-release BOSH release jobs folder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/master/jobs))

<pre class="terminal">
Binding instance VMs
  nats/0 (00:00:01)
  postgres/0 (00:00:01)
  nfs_server/0 (00:00:01)
  syslog_aggregator/0 (00:00:01)
  uaa/0 (00:00:01)
  hm9000/0 (00:00:01)
  router/0 (00:00:01)
  cloud_controller/0 (00:00:01)
  dea/0 (00:00:01)
Done                    9/9 00:00:04

Preparing configuration
  binding configuration (00:00:01)
Done                    1/1 00:00:01

Updating job syslog_aggregator
syslog_aggregator/0 (canary)       |oooooooooooooooooooo    | 0/1 00:01:09  ETA: --:--:--
</pre>

First the `syslog_aggregator` job is started.

The ordering of the jobs within the deployment file is deliberate. It determines the order that the job VMs are started. The later jobs may have dependencies on the earlier jobs already running.

DEAs (job `dea`) need the NATS (job `nats`) and the Cloud Controller (job `cloud_controller`). The Cloud Controller needs the UAA (job `uaa`). The Cloud Controller and the UAA need a PostgreSQL database (job `postgres`).

When the deployment is finished:

<pre class="terminal">
Updating job core
  core/0 (canary) (00:01:04)
Done                    1/1 00:01:04

Updating job uaa
  uaa/0 (canary) (00:00:47)
Done                    1/1 00:00:47

Updating job api
  api/0 (canary) (00:01:50)
Done                    1/1 00:01:50

Updating job dea
  dea/0 (canary) (00:01:21)
Done                    1/1 00:01:21
</pre>

## Running example application on Cloud Foundry ##

You can now target and push your first example application, as per the promise at the top of the page.

First, target the Cloud Foundry, create an Organization, and create the first Space within that organization:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gem install cf
$ cf target api.mycloud.com
$ cf login admin
Password> ******

$ cf create-org demo
Creating organization demo... OK
Switching to organization demo... OK
There are no spaces. You may want to create one with create-space.

$ cf create-space development
Creating space development... OK
Adding you as a manager... OK
Adding you as a developer... OK
Space created! Use `cf switch-space development` to target it.

$ cf switch-space development
Switching to space development... OK

target: http://api.mycloud.com
organization: demo
space: development
</pre>

Finally, clone an example application that does not require database services and push it to deploy:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf_demoapp_ruby_rack.git
$ cd cf_demoapp_ruby_rack
$ bundle
$ cf push
cf push
Using manifest file manifest.yml
