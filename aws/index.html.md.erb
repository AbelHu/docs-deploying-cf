title: Deploying Cloud Foundry on AWS
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The following steps document the process for deploying Cloud Foundry on AWS in
a production setup. For instance, Pivotal Web Services has been provisioned in
a similar fashion. This example includes several steps that may be expensive and time-consuming, such as provisioning AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)
instances. For a simpler deployment, check out the
[Minimal AWS](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/master/example_manifests) instructions.

## Environment Setup ##

* [Step 1](setup_aws.html): Use the BOSH AWS Bootstrap tool `bosh aws create` to create an environment on AWS that includes a VPC and other structures that support BOSH.

## Deploy BOSH ##

* [Step 2](setup_bosh_aws.html) Create a manifest for BOSH, and pass it to `bosh-init` to deploy BOSH in your environment.

## Deploy Cloud Foundry ##

* [Step 3](../common/create_a_manifest.html) Create a deployment manifest for Cloud Foundry.
* [Step 4](../common/deploy.html) Deploy!
