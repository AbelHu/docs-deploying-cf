<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The following steps document the process for deploying Cloud Foundry on AWS in
a production setup.  For instance, Pivotal Web Services has been provisioned in
a similar fashion.  This includes several steps that may be expensive and
time-consuming, e.g. provisioning AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)
instances.  For a simpler deployment, check out the
[Minimal AWS](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/master/example_manifests) instructions.
