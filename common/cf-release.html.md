title: Using the latest CF-Release
----------------------------------


[CF-Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) is the BOSH [release](/bosh/reference/index.html#bosh-release) repository for Cloud Foundry. Use this with a custom manifest for your environment to deploy Cloud Foundry.

This topic describes how after [bootstrapping BOSH](/deploying/), you can create a Cloud Foundry release ready to deploy to your environment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These instructions are for v170 release of Cloud Foundry. We strongly recommend using the [highest final version tag of [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases), though this may require you modify the deployment manifest.</p>

## <a id='clone'></a> Clone CF-Release ##
-----------------------------------

Create a folder for your clone of the CF-Release repository and clone the repo from Github:

<pre class="terminal">
mkdir -p ~/bosh-workspace/releases
cd ~/bosh-workspace/releases
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.git
cd cf-release
</pre>

## <a id='upload-the-release'></a> Upload the release ##
--------------------------------------------------

Releases of Cloud Foundry are published regularly (approximately weekly). You upload a release to your BOSH deployment using `bosh upload release`, substituting the `cf-170.yml` file with the cf-release version, which we recommend to be the [highest final version tag of cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases).

Run the following command to upload a release `.yml` file:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload release releases/cf-170.yml

Run the following command to check that you have successfully added the release:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh releases

| Name | Versions | Commit Hash |
+------+----------+-------------+
| cf   | 170      | 121623ca    |

</pre>

You can now deploy a release using a deployment manifest file.
