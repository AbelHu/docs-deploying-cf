title: Deploy Micro Bosh on AWS
---

We will leverage the Elastic IP, Security Group and Key Pair file that we created in Configuring AWS for Micro BOSH](./configure_aws_micro_bosh.html) to deploy a Micro BOSH server on AWS in four steps:

1. Create Directory Structure

2. Create Micro BOSH Deployment Manifest

3. Find the correct Micro BOSH Stemcell

4. Deploy Manifest

Much of this is borrowed from [here](http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2012/09/06/deploying-to-aws-using-cloud-foundry-bosh/).

### Create Directory Structure

Create a standard place to store the Deployment Manifest on your local computer:

<pre class="terminal">
mkdir -p ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/microboshes/deployments/microbosh

cd ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/microboshes/deployments/microbosh

touch microbosh.yml
</pre>

**Create Micro BOSH Deployment Manifest**

Now let’s review what the contents of the `microbosh.yml` deployment
manifest file should include. If you did not use the us-east-1a
availability zone, you will need to adjust that. We are using a small instance type for the Micro BOSH. Be sure to replace "x.x.x.x" with
the IP address you created in [Configuring AWS for Micro BOSH](./configure_aws_micro_bosh.html) and make sure to replace the AWS access credentials with your own.

~~~yaml
name: microbosh

logging:
  level: DEBUG

network:
  type: dynamic
  vip: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2

resources:
  persistent_disk: 20000
  cloud_properties:
    instance_type: m1.small
    availability_zone: us-east-1a

cloud:
  plugin: aws
  properties:
    aws:
      access_key_id: AKIAIYJWVDUP4KRESQ
      secret_access_key: EVGFswlmOvA33ZrU1ViFEtXC5Sugc19yPzoWRf
      default_key_name: bosh
      default_security_groups: ["bosh"]
      ec2_private_key: ~/.ssh/bosh
      ec2_endpoint: ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      region: us-east-1

apply_spec:
  agent:
    blobstore:
      address: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2
    nats:
      address: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2
  properties:
    aws_registry:
      address: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2
~~~

If you are using the sample manifest provided, confirm the following:

1. Make sure to update all of the instances of x.x.x.x IP with the appropriate elastic IP you created.

2. Add the AWS credentials under the AWS section.

3. Verify the AWS region added in the manifest.

Save your changes to the file.

**Find the correct Micro BOSH Stemcell**

It is important to deploy the correct AWS image that is compatible
with the version of Micro BOSH you install.

To obtain the current AMI, navigate to [http://bosh_artifacts.cfapps.io](http://bosh_artifacts.cfapps.io)
and download the "light-bosh (aws xen ubuntu)" tarball file
(.tar.gz). The light stemcell is just a wrapper pointing to a public
AMI. If you are not using us-east-1 as specified previously, there
may not be a public AMI available.

This downloads the tar file to you local computer. Extract this
and open the file named "stemcell.MF" in your text editor.

![image alt text](ec2/image_15.png)

This file contains the image name (AMI ID) for this version of the
bosh-cli. You will need this AMI ID for the next section.

### Deploy Manifest

Everything is now in place to use the deployment manifest you have
created and deploy Micro BOSH to AWS (the first inception). Let’s now
do this.

Enter the deployments folder you created earlier:

<pre class="terminal">
cd ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/microboshes/deployments
</pre>

Select the deployment you called "aws" by telling bosh which manifest file to use:

<pre class="terminal">
  bosh micro deployment microbosh/microbosh.yml
</pre>

Ignore the warning: it is not an error, but displays to inform you that the director was mapped to port 25555:

  ``WARNING! Your target has been changed to `[http://aws:25555](http://aws:25555)``!

Deploy the Micro BOSH AMI using the AMI we retrieved from the stem cell config:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh micro deploy ami-979dc6fe
</pre>

If the deployment fails, clean it up before trying again. If you get
errors regarding your access key signature, double check your keys in
`microbosh.yml` and try again. Many of the errors encountered at this
stage will likely be related to having missed a step in configuring AWS or an error in `microbosh.yml`.

<pre class="terminal">
bosh micro delete
</pre>

Log into the new Micro BOSH server:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh target 54.204.16.249
bosh login
</pre>

The default username and password are "admin" and “admin”.

If the deployment runs successfully, you will have a Micro BOSH VM deployed onto AWS.

A few things to note in the screenshot above:

1. **microbosh** - The name of the instance matches the deployment name.

2. **us-east-1a** - The availability zone in the deployment manifest

3. **bosh** - The name of the key pair

4. **bosh** - The name of the Security Group

5. **54.204.16.249**- The Elastic IP address that we created, which
is the external IP address for the Micro BOSH server
