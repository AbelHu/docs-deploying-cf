title: Deploying to AWS
---

This guide is intended to walk someone with minimal experience through an
end-to-end Cloud Foundry deployment running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2.
This includes installing the Command Line Interface (CLI) locally, installing
MicroBOSH, deploying BOSH from MicroBOSH on AWS, and deploying Cloud Foundry
from BOSH on AWS.

**WARNING**: On AWS, Cloud Foundry uses BOSH DNS, and BOSH DNS requires a
single-VM implementation of PostgreSQL.
This results in a non-fault-tolerant DNS situation.
In a production environment, use static IP addresses to communicate between
internal VMs in non-fault-tolerant DNS situations.
Detailing the steps to configure static IP addresses in a production environment
is beyond the scope of this guide.

##Installing MicroBOSH, BOSH, and Cloud Foundry on AWS ##

Complete the following steps to set up and deploy a full Cloud Foundry release using BOSH on AWS:

1. [Create an AWS Account](http://goo.gl/MaAybK) if you do not already have one.
