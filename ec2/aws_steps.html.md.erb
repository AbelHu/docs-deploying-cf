title: Deploying to AWS
---

This tutorial guides users who have minimal experience with Cloud Foundry deployments through deploying a test environment that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2.

In addition to configuring AWS components for Cloud Foundry, you must set up four Cloud Foundry components. This involves preparing two deployment manifest YAML files, one for MicroBOSH and one for Cloud Foundry, and uploading both a MicroBOSH stemcell and a Cloud Foundry release package. We describe these components in detail as you proceed through this tutorial.

##Installing MicroBOSH and Cloud Foundry on AWS ##

Complete the following steps to set up and deploy a Cloud Foundry release using MicroBOSH on AWS:

1. [Create an AWS Account](http://goo.gl/MaAybK), or sign in to your existing account.
