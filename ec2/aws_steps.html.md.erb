This tutorial guides users who have minimal experience with Cloud Foundry deployments through deploying a test environment that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2.

##Installing MicroBOSH and Cloud Foundry on AWS ##

Complete the following steps to set up and deploy a Cloud Foundry release using MicroBOSH on AWS:

1. [Create an AWS Account](http://goo.gl/MaAybK), or sign in to your existing account.

1. [Deploy MicroBOSH to AWS](/bosh/deploy-microbosh-to-aws.html)

1. [Configure AWS for Cloud Foundry](./configure_aws_cf.html)

1. [Deploy Cloud Foundry on AWS](./deploy_aws_cf.html)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On AWS, Cloud Foundry uses BOSH DNS, and BOSH DNS requires a single-VM implementation of PostgreSQL. This results in a non-fault-tolerant DNS situation. In a production environment, use static IP addresses to communicate between internal VMs in non-fault-tolerant DNS situations. Detailing the steps to configure static IP addresses in a production environment is not described in this guide.</p>
