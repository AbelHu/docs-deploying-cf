title: Deploying to AWS
---

This tutorial guides users who have minimal experience with Cloud Foundry deployments through deploying a test environment that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2.

In addition to configuring AWS components for Cloud Foundry, you must set up four Cloud Foundry components. This involves preparing two deployment manifest YAML files, one for MicroBOSH and one for Cloud Foundry, and uploading both a MicroBOSH stemcell and a Cloud Foundry release package. We describe these components in detail as you proceed through this tutorial.

##Installing MicroBOSH and Cloud Foundry on AWS ##

Complete the following steps to set up and deploy a Cloud Foundry release using MicroBOSH on AWS:

1. [Create an AWS Account](http://goo.gl/MaAybK), or sign in to your existing account.

1. [Deploy MicroBOSH to AWS](/bosh/deploy-microbosh-to-aws.html)

1. [Configure AWS for Cloud Foundry](./configure_aws_cf.html)

1. [Deploy Cloud Foundry on AWS](./deploy_aws_cf.html)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On AWS, Cloud Foundry uses BOSH DNS, and BOSH DNS requires a single-VM implementation of PostgreSQL. This results in a non-fault-tolerant DNS situation. In a production environment, use static IP addresses to communicate between internal VMs in non-fault-tolerant DNS situations. Detailing the steps to configure static IP addresses in a production environment is not described in this guide.</p>
