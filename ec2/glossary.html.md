## Inceptions

There are three "inceptions", starting with your local computer.

### Micro Inception

The local computer creates a Micro BOSH server.

### BOSH Inception

The local computer creates a full BOSH release set of servers.

### Cloud Foundry (CF) Inception

The local computer is used to create a set of Cloud Foundry servers
from a CF release.

## Elements

Every inception utilizes four elements: Stemcell, Release and Deployment Manifest, BOSH CLI and Security Groups.

### Stemcell

A **stemcell** is a specific operating system image containing a
pre-installed agent and associated package bits to support running a
 server. There are two types of stemcells that we will use: one for the MicroBOSH and one for the BOSH and CF servers. Stemcells are not interchangeable and are hypervisor specific.

### Deployment Manifest

The **deployment manifest** is a YAML (.yml) file that prescribes the
parameters by which the next server in the inception is configured.
During the first step, we create a deployment manifest file on the computer, which prescribes the configuration of one of the following: Micro BOSH, BOSH, or CF servers.

### Release

This file contains references to all the packages available to the stemcell. Like the deployment manifest, this is a YAML (yml) file and is deployed from the local server to the BOSH server.

### BOSH CLI

The **BOSH CLI** is a tool that allows you to consume the stemcell and control an inception of bosh.

### Security Groups

At each inception, additional ports need to be opened on AWS for pieces of the architecture to talk to each other.

## Local System

The local system used as an example within this document is a OSX
laptop. This does not need to be the case; any Linux/Unix/Windows
system should do. The details of using these other systems are outside
of the scope of this document.
