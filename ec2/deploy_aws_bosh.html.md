title: Deploying BOSH on AWS
---

This step leverages the new Elastic IP created in [Configuring AWS for BOSH](./configure_aws_bosh.html), as well as the Security Group and Key Pair file that we created in [Configuring AWS for MicroBOSH](./configure_aws_micro_bosh.html), to deploy a BOSH server on AWS in four steps:

**Note:** CF may be deployed straight from MicroBOSH, but this is typically not considered a reliable method and so it is not discussed here.


1. Create Directory Structure

2. Create BOSH Deployment Manifest

3. Locate the correct BOSH Stemcell

4. Deploy Manifest

### Obtain and Upload Release

Upload the most recent generic release:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh upload release https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/release/bosh-1274.tgz</td>
</pre>


### Create Directory Structure

Create a standard place to store the Deployment Manifest on your
local computer. You should still be targeting the MicroBOSH server:

<pre class="terminal">
  mkdir -p ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh
  cd ~/bosh-workspace/deployments/bosh
  touch bosh.yml
</pre>


**Locate the correct BOSH Stemcell**

It is important to deploy the correct AWS image that is compatible with the version of BOSH you will be installing.

To find and obtain the current BOSH stemcell, navigate to `http://bosh_artifacts.cfapps.io`, right click **Download**, and copy the link for the "bosh (aws xen ubuntu)" tarball file (.tar.gz).  An example of the link URL is:

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/bosh-stemcell/aws/bosh-stemcell-1274-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/bosh-stemcell/aws/bosh-stemcell-1274-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz)

![image alt text](ec2/image_25.png)

Upload the latest stemcell of BOSH onto the MicroBOSH server:

<pre class="terminal">
  bosh upload stemcell https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-jenkins-artifacts/bosh-stemcell/aws/bosh-stemcell-1274-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz
</pre>


After the upload completes, view the list of stemcells by calling:
<pre class="terminal">
  bosh stemcells
</pre>


**Create BOSH Deployment Manifest**

Now let's review what the contents of the bosh.yml deployment
manifest file should include. Notice the first comment in the
example file.  You'll need to replace that uuid with the one for the
results of the command:

<pre class="terminal">
  bosh status
</pre>

~~~yaml
name: bosh

# Execute the "bosh status" command to obtain the director_uuid.

Save your changes to the file.

### Deploy Manifest

Everything is now in place to use the deployment manifest you have created and deploy BOSH to AWS (the first inception). Let's now do this.

Enter the deployments folder you created earlier:

<pre class="terminal">
  cd ~/bosh-workspace/deployments
</pre>


Select the deployment you called "bosh" in the first section of [Configuring AWS for BOSH](./configure_aws_bosh.html):

<pre class="terminal">
bosh deployment bosh/bosh.yml
</pre>


Deploy the BOSH:

<pre class="terminal">
  bosh deploy
</pre>

The deploy command takes some time. You will also have several instances running
in EC2 while this happens. These extra instances are used to
distribute the compilation of packages needed for your BOSH virtual
machine. You can control the number of compilation workers in the
bosh.yml file we created above.

When the deploy command finishes, log into the new BOSH server and replace 
the IP address you created in Step 4 with the one below:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh target 23.21.249.15
</pre>

The default username and password are "admin" and "admin".

If the deployment ran successfully, you now have a BOSH instance deployed onto AWS.

Note a few things in this image:

![image alt text](ec2/image_26.png)

1. **bosh** - The name of the instance matches the deployment name.

2. **us-east-1a** - The availability zone in the deployment manifest

3. **bosh** - The name of the key pair

4. **bosh** - The name of the Security Group

5. **23.21.249.15**- The Elastic IP address that we created, which is also the external IP address for the BOSH server

**BOSH Deployment Failures**

If the deployment fails, run the following command to clean it up before trying again:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh delete deployment bosh
</pre>

###Go on to [Configuring AWS for CF](./configure_aws_cf.html) or [Return to Index](./index.html)
