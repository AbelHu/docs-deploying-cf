title: Deploying Cloud Foundry with Micro BOSH or BOSH
---

This guide describes the process for deploying Cloud Foundry to a vCloud environment using Micro BOSH or distributed BOSH. To keep it simple, the rest of this document will simply call it BOSH.

All of the commands below should be run from the jump box, in the `~/deployments` directory we created earlier.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

BOSH should be deployed. See the steps in the [previous](deploying_micro_bosh.html) [sections](deploying_bosh_with_micro_bosh.html).

## <a id="target"></a>Target New BOSH Director ##

Target the Director of the deployed BOSH using `bosh target` and the IP address of the Director. Login with admin/admin or the userid and password you set after installation.

<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh target https://192.168.109.81:25555
Target already set to `bosh_micro_vchs'
$ bosh status
Config
             /home/killian/.bosh_config

Director
  Name       bosh_micro_vchs
  URL        https://192.168.109.81:25555
  Version    1.0000.0 (release:125d9104 bosh:125d9104)
  User       admin
  UUID       566c47b3-ca85-47e2-95f6-32d095747acf
  CPI        vcloud
  dns        enabled (domain_name: microbosh)
  compiled_package_cache disabled
  snapshots  disabled

Deployment
  not set
</pre>

You will need the UUID of the BOSH Director in your Cloud Foundry deployment file later. It is provided in the above list of information also.

## <a id="upload-stemcell"></a>Upload a Stemcell ##

The Director needs a stemcell in order to deploy Cloud Foundry. If you followed the installation documentation, you should already have vcloud stemcell downloaded previously when you deployed Micro BOSH or BOSH. Please upload the same stemcell.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload stemcell ~/stemcells/bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu.tgz
Verifying stemcell...
File exists and readable                                     OK

## <a id="get-release"></a>Get a Cloud Release ##

For this exercise, we'll use a release from the public repository. Clone this repo in the `deployments` directory.

  <table style="width: 64%;"><tr><td>
  **WARNING**: This upload process works with the cf-147 release. The Cloud Foundry team have not verified other releases.
  </td></tr></table>

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.git
$ cd cf-release
$ bosh upload release releases/cf-xxx.yml
</pre>

You'll see a flurry of output as BOSH configures and uploads release components. Here's a shortened version:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload release releases/cf-147.yml

[… Lots of output …]

After finishing you should be able to see the release when you run `bosh releases`

<pre class="terminal">

## <a id="create-manifest"></a>Create a Cloud Foundry deployment manifest file ##

Create a manifest file in the `~/deployments` directory on the jump box, with the name `cf.yml.erb` indicating that it's a YAML file written using erb, the ruby templating engine. It allows us to fill in a set of properties at the beginning of the file and then run `erb cf.yml.erb > cf.yml` to generate a suitable manifest file in `cf.yml`.

Once you have prepared a manifest file, run `erb` to generate the final manifest file `cf.yml`. Then use the BOSH CLI to set the deployment manifest file:

<pre class="terminal">
$ erb ~/deployments/cf.yml.erb > ~/deployments/cf.yml
$ bosh deployment ~/deployments/cf.yml
Deployment set to '/home/user/deployments/cf.yml'
</pre>

## <a id="deploy"></a>Deploy Cloud Foundry ##

Now deploy Cloud Foundry via using the bosh command`bosh deploy`. This example shows only part of the expected output:

<pre class="terminal">

## <a id="verify"></a>Verify the Deployment ##

Execute the `bosh vms` command to see all the vas deployed.

Output of this command will similar to the listing below. Make sure the "State" of all the jobs is "running".

## <a id="login"></a>Log In ##

From your laptop try to target and log into your Cloud Foundry instance. You can now follow the instructions in the [cf](/devguide/index.html#cf) section of the Developer Guide to [install the cf](/devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html) command-line tool and push an application.

To log in, the manifest file includes a pre-defined account, user id `admin` and password `cdd0549963e8749b4a04` . You can modify or add to the list of pre-provisioned accounts in the generated manifest. In the jobs section look for uaa -> properties -> uaa ->

## <a id="fin"></a>Finishing up ##

If you run into issues the Troubleshooting section may be of some help.

We hope these instructions have been helpful. If you find errors, want to make updates or have suggestions for further enhancement we would greatly appreciate it. Please follow the standard processes on github (i.e. send pull requests and file issues), along with the bosh-users email list. You can learn more at [cloudfoundry.org](http://www.cloudfoundry.org)

Good luck with your Cloud Foundry deployments!
