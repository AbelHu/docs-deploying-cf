title: Deploying BOSH with MicroBOSH
---

This guide describes the process for deploying BOSH as an application using MicroBOSH.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

* MicroBOSH should be deployed. See the steps in the [Deploying MicroBOSH](deploying_micro_bosh.html) topic.

## <a id="target"></a>Target MicroBOSH ##

Once your MicroBOSH instance is deployed, you can target its Director:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh micro status
...
Target         micro (http://10.146.21.150:25555)

$ bosh target 10.146.21.150
Target set to 'your-micro-BOSH'
Your username: admin
Enter password: admin
Logged in as 'admin'
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Create a new user using `bosh create user`. This overrides the default username and password.</p>

## <a id="download-stemcell"></a>Download a BOSH Stemcell ##

List public stemcells with the `bosh public stemcells` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ mkdir -p ~/stemcells
$ cd ~/stemcells
$ bosh public stemcells

+---------------------------------------------+
| Name                                        |
+---------------------------------------------+
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz       |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-centos.tgz       |
| light-bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz |
| light-bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-centos.tgz |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-openstack-kvm-ubuntu.tgz |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu.tgz  |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vsphere-esxi-centos.tgz  |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu.tgz   |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vcloud-esxi-centos.tgz   |
+---------------------------------------------+
To download use `bosh download public stemcell <stemcell_name>'. For full url use --full.
</pre>

Download a public stemcell.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have already downloaded a stemcell to deploy your MicroBOSH, you do not need to download a different one.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh download public stemcell bosh-stemcell-XXXX-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu.tgz
</pre>

Upload the downloaded stemcell to MicroBOSH.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload stemcell bosh-stemcell-XXXX-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu.tgz
</pre>

You can see the uploaded stemcells on your MicroBOSH by using the `bosh stemcells` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh stemcells

## <a id="upload-release"></a>Upload a BOSH Release ##

Locate and download the latest BOSH release file from [https://bosh-artifacts.cfapps.io/file_collections?type=releases](https://bosh-artifacts.cfapps.io/file_collections?type=releases).

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload release bosh-XXXX.tgz
</pre>

## <a id="deploy"></a>Setup a BOSH Deployment Manifest and Deploy ##

Create and setup a BOSH deployment manifest. See the [BOSH Example Manifest](./bosh-example-manifest.html).

Deploy BOSH. The following example assumes that your manifest is named `bosh.yml` and exists in the `/home/bosh_user` directory.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cd /home/bosh_user
$ bosh deployment bosh.yml

Deployment set to `/home/bosh_user/bosh.yml'

$ bosh deploy

Getting deployment properties from director...
Unable to get properties list from director, trying without it...

## <a id="verify"></a>Verify the Installation ##

The example BOSH Director has the IP address `10.146.21.153`. Target this Director with `bosh target 172.20.134.52` to verify a successful installation.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh target 10.146.21.153
Target set to 'your-director'
