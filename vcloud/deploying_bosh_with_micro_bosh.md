title: Deploying BOSH with Micro BOSH
---

This guide describes the process for deploying BOSH as an application using micro BOSH. 

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

* Micro BOSH should be deployed. See the steps in the [previous section](deploying_micro_bosh.html)

## <a id="target"></a>Target Micro BOSH ##

Once your micro BOSH instance is deployed, you can target its Director:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh micro status
...
Target         micro (http://10.146.21.150:25555) 

$ bosh target 10.146.21.150
Target set to 'your-micro-BOSH'
Your username: admin
Enter password: admin
Logged in as 'admin'

*Note*: Create a new user using `bosh create user` which overrides the default username and password.

## <a id="download-stemcell"></a>Download a BOSH Stemcell ##

List public stemcells with the `bosh public stemcells` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ mkdir -p ~/stemcells
$ cd ~/stemcells
$ bosh public stemcells

+---------------------------------------------+
| Name                                        |
+---------------------------------------------+
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz       |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-centos.tgz       |
| light-bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-ubuntu.tgz |
| light-bosh-stemcell-xxxx-aws-xen-centos.tgz |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-openstack-kvm-ubuntu.tgz |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu.tgz  |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vsphere-esxi-centos.tgz  |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu.tgz   |
| bosh-stemcell-xxxx-vcloud-esxi-centos.tgz   |
+---------------------------------------------+
To download use `bosh download public stemcell <stemcell_name>'. For full url use --full.
</pre>

Download a public stemcell. *Note*: if you have already downloaded a stemcell to deploy your micro BOSH, you can use that one.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh download public stemcell bosh-stemcell-XXXX-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu.tgz
</pre>

Upload the downloaded stemcell to micro BOSH.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload stemcell bosh-stemcell-XXXX-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu.tgz
</pre>

You can see the uploaded stemcells (on your Micro BOSH) by using `bosh stemcells`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh stemcells

+-------------------------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+

</pre>

## <a id="upload-release"></a>Upload a BOSH release ##

You can find and download the latest bosh release file from [here](http://bosh_artifacts.cfapps.io/file_collections?type=releases) 

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh upload release bosh-XXXX.tgz
</pre>

## <a id="deploy"></a>Setup a BOSH Deployment Manifest and Deploy ##

Create and setup a BOSH deployment manifest. Look at the [BOSH example manifest](./bosh-example-manifest.html). 

Deploy BOSH. (the following assumes your manifest is named `bosh.yml` in `/home/bosh_user`).

<pre class="terminal">
$ cd /home/bosh_user
$ bosh deployment bosh.yml
		
Deployment set to `/home/bosh_user/bosh.yml'

$ bosh deploy

Getting deployment properties from director...
Unable to get properties list from director, trying without it...

## <a id="verify"></a>Verification ##

The example BOSH director has the IP address `10.146.21.153`. Targeting this director with `bosh target 10.146.21.153` will verify a successful installation.
