title: Security Configuration for Consul
---

As of [cf-release v217](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v217), Cloud Foundry enables secure traffic between Consul agents by default using encryption and mutual authentication. We strongly recommend that you configure Consul to be secure.

Follow the instructions below to configure security for Consul.

##<a id='create-stub'></a>Step 1: Create Stub File ##

You can configure Consul to be secure or insecure. 
We strongly recommend that you configure Consul to be secure.

###<a id='secure'></a>Configure Secure Mode ###

1. <a id='generate-certs'></a>Generate SSL Certificates and Keys

    To generate the certificates and keys that you need for Consul, we 
    recommend using [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap). 

    The [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) repository 
    contains a helper script, `scripts/generate-consul-certs`. 
    This script uses certstrap to initialize a certificate authority (CA), and 
    generate the certificates and keys for Consul.

    If you already have a CA, you may have an existing workflow. 
    You can modify the `generate-consul-certs` script to use your existing CA 
    instead of generating a new one.
    <br>
    The `generate-consul-certs` script outputs files to the `./consul-certs` 
    directory. 
    You use the contents of these output files in a later step, [Create and Edit Stub File](#stub).

2. <a id='encrypt-keys'></a>Generate Gossip Encryption Keys

    Run `cat /dev/urandom | head -c 16 | base64` to generate and display a 
    random 16-byte Base64-encoded value. 
    You use this Gossip encryption key as the `encrypts_key` in a later step, 
    [Create and Edit Stub File](#stub).

    Example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cat /dev/urandom | head -c 16 | base64
    8b9IJjXH5aN2Z9A5H8HAmg==
    </pre>

3. <a id='stub'></a>Create and Edit Stub File

    Create a stub file that includes the certificates keys and `encrypts_key`. 
    You use this stub file with the `generate_deployment_manifest` script from 
    `cf-release` to generate a deployment manifest.
    
    1. In the `cf-release` directory, create a stub file named 
    `consul-stub.yml`. 
    
    1. Copy the following text into the `consul-stub.yml` file: 

        ```yaml
        properties:
          consul:
            encrypt_keys: 
			- RANDOM-16-BYTE-BASE64-ENCODED-VALUE
			- RANDOM-16-BYTE-BASE64-ENCODED-VALUE
            ca_cert: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            agent_cert: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            agent_key: |
              -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
              ...
              -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            server_cert: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
            server_key: |
              -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
              ...
              -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        ```
    
    1. Copy the contents of the files in the `./consul-certs` directory to 
    the `consul-stub.yml` file. 
    You generated these files in a previous step, [Generate SSL Certificates  and Keys](#generate-certs).

    1. Replace RANDOM-16-BYTE-BASE64-ENCODED-VALUE with the 
    `encrypt_keys` that you generated in a previous step, [Generate Gossip  Encryption Keys](#encrypt-keys).

### <a id='insecure'></a>Configure Insecure Mode ###

1. In the `cf-release` directory, create a stub file named `consul-stub.yml`.

1. Add the following text to the `consul-stub.yml` file: 

    ```yaml
    properties:
      consul:
        require_ssl: false
    ```

## <a id='manifest'></a>Step 2: Generate Deployment Manifest ##

Use the instructions for your infrastructure to generate a deployment 
manifest with the stub file that you created in [Step 1: Create Stub File](#create-stub):
