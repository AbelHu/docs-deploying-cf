title: Overview of Deploying Cloud Foundry
owner: Release Integration
---

Cloud Foundry is designed to be configured, deployed, managed, scaled, and
upgraded on any cloud IaaS provider. This is achieved by leveraging
[BOSH](https://bosh.io/), an open source tool for release engineering,
deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.

At a high level, the steps are the same regardless of IaaS:

1. Set up all external dependencies, such as IaaS account, external load balancers, DNS records, and any additional components.
2. Create a manifest to deploy a BOSH Director.
3. Deploy the BOSH Director.
4. Create a manifest to deploy Cloud Foundry.
5. Deploy Cloud Foundry.

We also offer an easy `vagrant up` solution for steps 1-3 so you can get
straight to pushing apps or hacking on Cloud Foundry itself.

Select one of the core supported infrastructures below to get started:

* [AWS](aws/index.html)
* [OpenStack](openstack/index.html)
* [vSphere](vsphere/index.html)
* [vCloud Air or vCloud Director](vcloud/index.html)

Or if you just want the `vagrant up` experience, choose:

* [BOSH-Lite](boshlite/index.html)
