title: Hardware Requirements
---

This page shows the hardware requirements for installing BOSH and Cloud Foundry on vSphere.

Cloud Foundry requires an ESXi host on which to run. The hardware requirements for running ESXi 5.5 can be found [here](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2052329).

Cloud Foundry also requires a vCenter to manage the ESXi host. The hardware requirements for running vCenter Server can be found [here](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2005086).

## Minimum Requirements

The ESXi host where you install Cloud Foundry must have the following resources available:

* Processor: **2 Physical CPU Cores** (hyperthreading does not count)
* RAM: **48 GiB RAM**
* Hard Disk Space: **500 GB**
* 1 NIC (Network Interface Controller)

## Recommended

For internal small-scale testing and proof-of-concept, we recommend the following:

* Processor: **8 Physical CPU Cores** (hyperthreading does not count)
* RAM: **128 GiB RAM**
* Hard Disk Space: **1 TB**
* 2 NICs (Network Interface Controller)
