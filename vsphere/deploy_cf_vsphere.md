title: Deploying Cloud Foundry on vSphere using BOSH
---

This topic describes the process for deploying Cloud Foundry to a vSphere environment using BOSH.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Run all the commands in this topic from the <code>~/deployments</code> directory of the jump box that you created in the <a href="deploying_micro_bosh.html"> Deploying MicroBOSH on vSphere</a> topic.</p>

##<a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

You must have deployed BOSH to your vSphere. For instructions, see [Deploying BOSH using MicroBOSH on vSphere](deploying_bosh_with_micro_bosh.html)

##<a id="target"></a>Target the BOSH Director ##

Use the `bosh target` command with the IP address of the BOSH Director to
connect to the BOSH Director.
Log in with the default user name and password, `admin` and `admin`, or use the
user name and password that you set when you installed BOSH.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh target https://192.168.109.81:25555
Target set to `bosh_vsphere'
Your username: admin
Enter password: *****
Logged in as 'admin'
</pre>

##<a id="uuid"></a>Record the BOSH Director UUID ##

Use the `bosh status` command to view information about your BOSH deployment.
Record the UUID of the BOSH Director. You use the UUID when [Customizing the Cloud Foundry Deployment Manifest Stub for vSphere](../cf-stub-vsphere.html).

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh status

##<a id="stemcell"></a>Upload a Stemcell ##

1. Use the `bosh public stemcells` command to view a list of available public
stemcells.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh public stemcells
    +-----------------------------------------------------------+
    | Name                                                      |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------+
	| bosh-stemcell-2710-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-lucid-go_agent.tgz |
	| bosh-stemcell-2652-aws-xen-centos.tgz                     |
	| bosh-stemcell-2751-aws-xen-centos-go_agent.tgz            |
	| bosh-stemcell-2427-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-go_agent.tgz       |
	| bosh-stemcell-2710-vcloud-esxi-ubuntu-lucid-go_agent.tgz  |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------+
    To download use `bosh download public stemcell &lt;stemcell_name&gt;'. For full url use --full.
    </pre>

1. Use the `bosh download public stemcell` command to download the latest
stemcell for `vshere` with `ubuntu`.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh download public stemcell bosh-stemcell-2710-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-lucid-go_agent.tgz
    </pre>

1. Use the `bosh upload stemcell` command to upload the stemcell to the BOSH
Director.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh upload stemcell ./bosh-stemcell-2710-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-lucid-go_agent.tgz
    </pre>

##<a id="create-stub"></a>Create a Deployment Manifest Stub ##

Create a manifest stub file named `cf-stub.yml`. [Customize the manifest stub](../cf-stub-vsphere.html) for your environment.

##<a id="deploy-cf"></a>Deploy Cloud Foundry##

1. Clone the `cf-release` GitHub repository.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.git
    </pre>

1. Use the `update` helper script to update the `cf-release` submodules.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cd cf-release
    $ ./update
    </pre>

1. Install [Spiff](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff).

1. Run the following Spiff command from the `cf-release` directory to create a deployment manifest named `cf-deployment.yml`:

    `./generate_deployment_manifest INFRASTRUCTURE MANIFEST-STUB > cf-deployment.yml`

    Replace INFRASTRUCTURE with `vsphere` and replace MANIFEST-STUB with the name and location of your `cf-stub.yml file`. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
	$ ./generate_deployment_manifest aws cf-stub.yml > cf-deployment.yml
    </pre>

1. Use `bosh target` to target the BOSH Director.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh target
	Current target is https://192.168.109.81:25555
    </pre>

1. Set your deployment to the generated manifest.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh deployment cf-deployment.yml
    </pre>

1. Use `bosh create release` to create a Cloud Foundry release.
This command prompts you for a development release name.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh create release
    </pre>

1. Use `bosh upload release` to upload the generated release to the BOSH
Director.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh upload release
    </pre>

1. Deploy the uploaded Cloud Foundry release.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh deploy
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <code>bosh deploy</code> can take 2-3 hours to complete.</p>

1. Use `curl` to test the API endpoint of your Cloud Foundry installation.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ curl api.subdomain.domain/info
    </pre>

    If `curl` succeeds, it should return the JSON-formatted information.
	If `curl` does not succeeds, check your networking and make sure your domain
	has an NS record for your subdomain.

1. You should be able to target your Cloud Foundry installation with the [cf Command Line Interface (CLI)](/devguide/installcf/index.html) and log in as an
administrator.

    The user name, `admin` and the password, `fakepassword`, are specified in
    the deployment manifest under **uaa:scim:users**.

    For more information about managing organizations, spaces, users, and
    applications, refer to the [cf](/devguide/installcf/index.html) topic.

##<a id="update-cf"></a>Update Cloud Foundry##

* If you make change to your manifest, run `bosh deploy` to update your Cloud
Foundry deployment with these changes.

* If you make changes to the `cf-release` directory, run `bosh create release && bosh upload release && bosh deploy` to update your Cloud Foundry deployment with
these changes.

## <a id="verify"></a>Verify the Deployment ##

1. Run `bosh vms`. This command provides an overview of the virtual machines that BOSH manages as part of the current deployment. The state of every VM should show as **running**.

<pre class="terminal">
	$ bosh vms
